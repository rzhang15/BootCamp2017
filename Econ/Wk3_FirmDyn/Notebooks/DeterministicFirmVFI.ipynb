    "The firm's optimization problem can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V(z,k) = max_{k'} \\pi(z,k) - p^{k}(k'-(1-\\delta)k) - c(k',k) + \\beta V(z',k') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We going to assume that $z$ is deterministic and stationary.  Thus we'll set $z=1$ for all time and drop it from our vector of state variables.  In addition, assume that the price of new capital is equal to one; $p^{k}=1$.  Rewriting the problem we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V(k) = max_{k'} \\pi(k) - (k'-(1-\\delta)k) - c(k',k) + \\beta V(k') \\ \\ (1) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to solve for $V(k)$ and the policy function, $k'=h(k)$.  To do this, we are going to use the recursive nature of the problem.  In particular, we are going to use a fixed point algorithm and the fact that the value funciton, $V(\\cdot)$ appears on both sides of the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we are going to look for the fixed point for the mapping $T(V(k))$ defined as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ T(V(k)) = max_{k'} \\pi(k) - (k'-(1-\\delta)k) - c(k',k) + \\beta V(k') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $V(k)$ represents a proposed solution to the Equation (1) above.  If $T(V(k))=V(k)$ then $V(k)$ *is* the solution to (1).  Value function iteration uses this mapping to find the solution.  Under certain assumptions, it is shown that such a solution exists, is unique, and can be found by iterating on any initial proposed value function.  See Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott (1989, pp. 49-55) for details on the necessary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a solution.  Suffice it to say, those conditions are met in the problem as parameterized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we'll take, then, is to guess an initial value function, $V_{0}(k)$ and then iterate on this guess with the operators $T(v(k))$ so that we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_{i+1}(k) = max_{k'} \\pi(k) - (k'-(1-\\delta)k) - c(k',k) + \\beta V_{i}(k') $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $i$ denotes the iteration.  These iterations will continue until $V_{i+1}(k)=V_{i}(k)$, i.e., when we've found the fixed point.  This fixed point will be the solution to our problem, $V(k)=V_{i}(k)$.  With this found, we can then find the policy function, $h(k)$ that corresponds to this value function.\n",

    "### 2.2 Discretizing the state space for capital\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem we will be evaluating the value function over a discrete grid of points in the state space.  Our state space are the possible values of the firm's capital stock.  We need to put some thought into how to choose these grid points, since we are approximating the continuous value function over this grid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, recall the solution to the firm's problem without adjustment costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ k_{t+1} = \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{k}}{\\bar{r}  + \\delta}\\right)^{1-\\alpha_{l}}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{l}}{w}\\right)^{\\alpha_{l}}z_{t+1}^{\\alpha_{l}}\\right]^{1-\\alpha_{k}-\\alpha_{l}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are setting $z=1$, so we have:\n",

    "$$ k_{t+1} = \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{k}}{\\bar{r}  + \\delta}\\right)^{1-\\alpha_{l}}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{l}}{w}\\right)^{\\alpha_{l}}\\right]^{1-\\alpha_{k}-\\alpha_{l}} \\ \\ \\ (2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value for $k'$ in the model with no adjustment costs is a good place to center the grid as it's close to the steady-state value of the problem with adjustment costs.  In the steady-state, the firm's capital stock does not change and thus with the adjustment cost function specified, only small costs are paid as investment is just enough to offset depreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to think about how to space the grid points.  One consideration here is that since we are approximating a value function that is concave, we want to have more grid points in the space where there is more curvature in the function.  That is, we want more grid points on the part of the grid with smaller amounts of capital as the value function will have more curvature in this range since it's a concave function.  Second, there is some convenience in spacing the grid points out so that we know the number of points between the points for $k$ and $(1-\\delta)k$ (this will be more apparent when we get to models with other types of adjustment costs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these two considerations, let us define `dens` as the number of grid points between $k$ and $(1-\\delta)k$ and then define the sequence of grid points by\n",

    "$$ k^{i} = (1-\\delta)^{\\frac{1}{\\texttt{dens}}}k^{i+1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement this in the code below, setting the lower bound of the capital grid to a small, positive number, the upper bound to a multiple of the $k'$ implied by Equation (2), and then determining the number of grid points between these bounds given our rule for spacing described above."
